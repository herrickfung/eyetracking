practice.py is the code that i'm currently running for my experiment, which i modified from picture.py to fit my purpose, you might find picture.py helpful if you're not doing gaze contingent.

all other files (listed below) needs to be under the same directory as your code file
- EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy.py
- the three .wav files
- the images folder

the /images/practice_set directory is the stimuli set for practice.py to run, you may remove it later
